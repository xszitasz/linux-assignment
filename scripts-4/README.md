1. **Create a script that loops and creates multiple files:**
   - Files: `test-{$i}.txt`, `test-{$i}.log`, `test-{$i}` (without extension).
   - Add random text to the `.txt` files.

2. **Create another script that:**
   - Deletes all files with the `.log` extension.
   - Deletes every fifth file without an extension.
   - Removes all `.txt` files containing a specific word (the word will be input by the script).
